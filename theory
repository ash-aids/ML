Here’s a brief summary of each topic, covering the key points you’ll need for a practical exam:

---

### 1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - **Purpose**: Dimensionality reduction by transforming data into a set of uncorrelated **principal components**.
   - **Process**:
     - **Standardize** the data.
     - Calculate the **covariance matrix** and find its **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors**.
     - Select top components that capture the most **variance**.
   - **Use Case**: Simplify datasets, like distinguishing wine types by key variables.

### 2. **Regression Analysis**
   - **Linear Regression**: Models a linear relationship between predictors and target.
   - **Ridge and Lasso**: Add **L2** (Ridge) and **L1** (Lasso) penalties to avoid **overfitting** and handle multicollinearity.
   - **Metrics**:
     - **R-squared (R²)**: Variance explained by the model.
     - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Average prediction error.
   - **Use Case**: Predicting continuous values like Uber fares.

### 3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - **Purpose**: Finds the best hyperplane to classify data.
   - **Kernel Trick**: Transforms non-linear data for better separation (e.g., **RBF** kernel for complex data).
   - **Parameters**: **C** (regularization) controls misclassification tolerance; **Gamma** defines influence scope.
   - **Use Case**: Classifying images, like handwritten digits, into classes (0-9).

### 4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - **Purpose**: Unsupervised grouping of data points into **k clusters**.
   - **Steps**:
     - Randomly assign centroids.
     - Assign points to nearest centroid and update centroids.
     - Repeat until convergence.
   - **Elbow Method**: Determines optimal \( k \) by finding the "elbow" in the plot of inertia vs. number of clusters.
   - **Use Case**: Segment data, like clustering flower types in the Iris dataset.

### 5. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - **Purpose**: Ensemble of decision trees for classification, improving accuracy and reducing overfitting.
   - **Key Parameters**:
     - **n_estimators**: Number of trees.
     - **max_features**: Number of features considered per split.
     - **max_depth**: Tree depth control.
   - **Feature Importance**: Identifies the most significant features.
   - **Use Case**: Predicting categorical labels, like car safety ratings.

### 6. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Q-Learning**
   - **Purpose**: Training an agent to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Agent** interacts with **environment** through **states**, **actions**, and **rewards**.
     - **Q-Learning**: Updates **Q-values** based on rewards and future value estimates.
     - **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balances learning new actions vs. using known good actions.
   - **Use Case**: Navigation tasks, like finding the shortest path in a maze.

Each technique serves different purposes:
- **PCA and Clustering** for data exploration and dimensionality reduction.
- **Regression and Random Forest** for prediction tasks.
- **SVM and Q-Learning** for classification and sequential decision-making.

Understanding these topics’ key parameters, evaluation metrics, and main applications will prepare you to implement and evaluate models effectively in a practical setting.
